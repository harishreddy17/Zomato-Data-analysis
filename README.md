# ZOMATO DATA ANALYSIS

There is so much Zomato data of restaurants of different location in pune city is available. The Purpose of this project is to analyse all the data we have available and we have to get different Insights from data. From that insights we can analyse all the data according to our requirements to get maximum benefits from the data.


## Working:
I have downloaded data of Zomato Pune city from internet. Then with the help of Python pandas library I imported data checked weather any missing values are available in data. The I used another library as matplotlib to analyse the data visually. Here with the help of different charts we can analyse the data.
## LIBRARIES USED:
Pandas: Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis

NumPy: NumPy is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays

Seaborn: Seaborn is a library that uses Matplotlib underneath to plot graphs. It will be used to visualize random distributions

From above charts I observed that with the help of bar plot I can see the number of restaurants that are present in different locations of Pune, and from histogram shows the number of restaurants as per rating

As see in above with the help of pandas, i can identify the null values and duplicate values. And also, we can replace them with new values or drop them. I have dropped all the duplicate values as they are not the important. 
With pie chart we can easily visualise the no. of restaurants in different locations.

## CONCLUSION
In this project I have analysed all the data by using pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. 
Pandas helped to clean the data, remove the null values and duplicate values, where as with the help of matplotlib and seaborn I have analysed data from bar plot, histogram, pie chart, etc and we got different insights from different charts.
